            <h2> Blog Post 10/29/18</h2>
            Today is a Monday, so that means it's a school day, but since this quarter I only have classes from Tuesdays through Fridays, I figured I'd just
            complete this lab and get it over with. I finished it in the span of a couple days! Honestly it felt much easier than the first lab. I hope I can
            just reuse these scripts or just go back to them because I'd love to keep this website for my own personal use, and work on it some more.
            I've been playing Fortnite recently and I have been trying to figure out how to study for my other two classes, and I think I'll study for one of them
            after I finish this blog. Anyways thanks for stopping by and check in next week for my next post!

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            My name is Eddie Ortega and I grew up in Garden Grove, California. I like to run, draw, and play music. That's honestly about it. 
            I'm your pretty average human being aside from the fact I am really happy most of the time and you'll rarely find me in a bad mood. 
            I also like video games and I pay extra attention to detail in everything I do. Like in designing this website! I'm studying for business 
            currently but I feel like I am my happiest when expressing my artistic side or performing for others. I'll figure out my life eventually. <br><br>
            So what do I like to eat? Well how kind of you to ask:<br>
            Sushi üç£<br>
            Chicken Fingers üêî<br>
            and Alfredo Pasta üçú<br>
            So if you wanna talk to me about any of these.. hit me up.<br><br>
