            <h2> Blog Post 10/30/18</h2>
            I finally got my own domain! Wow. Feels great to finally have my own website. And it looks great, too!
            I'm not sure where to go from now, all I know about coding at the moment is just adding HTML text like this, and maybe a picture, with CSS
            making it look pretty. But I'll figure it out. This website can grow! Anyways today I skipped lecture today to hang out with Griffen and my new friend Monica. I think my social life is coming together now! Sorta. Schoolwork isn't looking too difficult but I don't see myself becoming a 5-star A+ student. Anyways I guess I could make this site more special by having a Do Online Now, Guys activity at the end of every blog post for now? Here's one I picked out. Check it out!<br><br>

            Today is a Monday, so that means it's a school day, but since this quarter I only have classes from Tuesdays through Fridays, I figured I'd just
            complete this lab and get it over with. I finished it in the span of a couple days! Honestly it felt much easier than the first lab. I hope I can
            just reuse these scripts or just go back to them because I'd love to keep this website for my own personal use, and work on it some more.
            I've been playing Fortnite recently and I have been trying to figure out how to study for my other two classes, and I think I'll study for one of them
            after I finish this blog. Anyways thanks for stopping by and check in next week for my next post!<br><br>

            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            My name is Eddie Ortega and I grew up in Garden Grove, California. I like to run, draw, and play music. That's honestly about it. 
            I'm your pretty average human being aside from the fact I am really happy most of the time and you'll rarely find me in a bad mood. 
            I also like video games and I pay extra attention to detail in everything I do. Like in designing this website! I'm studying for business 
            currently but I feel like I am my happiest when expressing my artistic side or performing for others. I'll figure out my life eventually. <br><br>
            So what do I like to eat? Well how kind of you to ask:<br>
            Sushi üç£<br>
            Chicken Fingers üêî<br>
            and Alfredo Pasta üçú<br>
            So if you wanna talk to me about any of these.. hit me up.<br><br>
